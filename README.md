# Zomato_Analysis
Zomato Sales World Wide

Zomato has become one of the largest food delivery application world wide. This repository contains analysis of zomato food delivery reach world wide and their sales among the countries. The dataset was provided during my course work as a project and here's what I have analysed and built few dashboards using Excel, PowerBI and Tableau. Along with these I have used SQL for querying the data and getting insights about Zomato sales country-wise, city-wise, cuisine-wise and how much would be the average-table booking for 2 persons.

This project analyzes Zomato's sales data to uncover insights into restaurant distribution, customer preferences, online food ordering trends, and cuisine popularity.
Using Excel dashboards and data visualization tools like Power BI/Tableau, this analysis provides a clear understanding of 
1.Which countries have the most restaurants?
2.What are the most popular cuisines?
3.How do customers behave on weekdays vs. weekends?
4.What percentage of users prefer online delivery?
